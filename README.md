# OS1 Evolutionary Agent Ecosystem

## Project Overview

The OS1 Evolutionary Agent Ecosystem is an ambitious AI framework that combines neural-symbolic processing with evolutionary algorithms to create an adaptive, self-improving agent system. This project represents a significant step toward building OS1, a sophisticated AI system with orchestration, agentic behavior, and advanced self-improvement capabilities.

The framework leverages neural-symbolic (NeSy) units as its foundational building blocks, allowing for both neural network learning and symbolic reasoning. These units are assembled into agents that can evolve and specialize through natural selection mechanisms, continuously improving their capabilities based on performance feedback.

## Key Features

- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning for more robust AI capabilities
- **Evolutionary Agent Development**: Agents evolve through selection and mutation to improve performance
- **Emergent Specialization**: Agents naturally specialize based on their performance on different task types
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: A meta-agent orchestrates cooperation between specialized agents
- **Self-Improvement Mechanisms**: Performance feedback drives continuous learning and adaptation
- **Memory Systems**: Episodic, semantic, and working memory enable knowledge retention and transfer
- **Modular Design**: Highly extensible architecture based on dependency injection and strategy patterns
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Web-based visualization tools for monitoring agent performance and evolution

## Architecture

The system is structured in layers of increasing complexity:

1. **NeSy Units**: The fundamental building blocks, combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning
2. **Agents**: Collections of NeSy units organized to solve specific types of tasks
3. **Agent Factory**: Creates, manages, and evolves agent blueprints and instances
4. **Meta-Agent**: Orchestrates the entire ecosystem, managing task assignment and evolution
5. **Monitoring System**: Visualizes and tracks system performance and evolution

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Basic Agent

```python
from evolutionary_agent_ecosystem import MetaAgent, AgentBlueprint
import numpy as np

# Initialize the meta-agent
meta_agent = MetaAgent()

# Create a blueprint
input_size = 3
hidden_size = 2
output_size = 1

# Random weights initialization
input_weights = np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size).tolist()
hidden_weights = np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size).tolist()

blueprint = AgentBlueprint(
    name="DataProcessor",
    description="Specialized for data processing tasks",
    capabilities=["data_processing", "filtering"],
    nesy_unit_configs=[
        {
            "unit_id": "data_input",
            "unit_type": "DataInputProcessor",
            "neural_state": {
                "weights": input_weights,
                "bias": np.zeros(hidden_size).tolist()
            },
            "symbolic_state": {
                "facts": ["is_active", "can_handle_data_processing"]
            },
            "configuration": {
                "activation": "sigmoid",
                "learning_rate": 0.01
            }
        },
        # Additional units...
    ],
    meta_parameters={
        "use_working_memory": True,
        "reflection_enabled": False
    }
)

# Register blueprint and create agent
meta_agent.register_blueprint(blueprint)
agent_id = meta_agent.create_agent(blueprint=blueprint)
```

### Processing Tasks

```python
# Define a task
task = {
    "id": "data_task_1",
    "type": "data_processing",
    "inputs": {"x1": 0.5, "x2": 0.3, "x3": 0.7},
    "description": "Basic data processing task"
}

# Process the task
result = meta_agent.process_task(task)
print(f"Task completed with status: {result['status']}")
```

### Evolving Specialized Agents

```python
# Evolve agents specialized for prediction tasks
prediction_agent_id = meta_agent.evolve_agent_population(
    task_types=["prediction"],
    population_size=10,
    generations=5
)

# Test the evolved agent
prediction_task = {
    "id": "prediction_task_1",
    "type": "prediction",
    "inputs": {"x1": 0.6, "x2": 0.2, "x3": 0.8}
}

result = meta_agent.process_task(prediction_task)
```
